# PersistentSSHAccess
This repository provides a solution for persistently storing and easily accessing SSH connections. Avoid repetitive entry of lengthy SSH commands by managing configurations for recurring access to various hosts. Ideal for automating and simplifying SSH connections across different environments and scenarios.

### Steps to Fix:

1. **Install Zsh Completions:**

   Ensure you have the Zsh Completions plugin installed. If you're using Homebrew, you can install it with the following command:

   ```sh
   brew install zsh-completions
```

Add Zsh Completions to Your Zsh Configuration:

Add the following lines to your ```~/.zshrc``` file to enable Zsh Completions:shCode kopieren
```sh
if type brew &amp;&gt;/dev/null; then
    FPATH=$(brew --prefix)/share/zsh-completions:$FPATH

    autoload -Uz compinit
    compinit
fi
```

Ensure Angular CLI Completion Script is Loaded Correctly:

It seems the issue might be related to the Angular CLI Completion script. Try including the completion script in your ```~/.zshrc``` file after initializing ```compinit```:shCode kopieren
```sh
# Zsh Completions
if type brew &amp;&gt;/dev/null; then
    FPATH=$(brew --prefix)/share/zsh-completions:$FPATH

    autoload -Uz compinit
    compinit
fi

# Load Angular CLI autocompletion
if [ -f &lt;(ng completion script) ]; then
    source &lt;(ng completion script)
fi
```

Review Your ```~/.zshrc``` File and Save Changes:

Double-check that your ```~/.zshrc``` file looks similar to the example provided above, especially ensuring the correct paths and commands are used.

Reload the ```~/.zshrc``` File:

After making changes, reload your ```~/.zshrc``` file to apply the updates:shCode kopieren
```sh
source ~/.zshrc
```
